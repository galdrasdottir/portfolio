						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>I'm a programmer and textile artisan based in Scotland. I  knit, sew, mend, embroider, and play with thread in various other ways. My degrees are in languages and culture, with a particular focus on medieval European literature, and I'm interested in stories and human connection to the land.</p>
						<p>Hire me to make you a website, mend your coat, or tell you medieval facts!</p>
						<p>I currently work as a soft toy restoration expert, bringing old beloved teddies and dolls back to life, and as a freelance artist teaching and selling a variety of textile crafts.</p>

					<h3>Textile practice</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Teddy Restoration: I do expert invisible repair and restoration of modern and vintage soft toys, including specialist materials. This work is all about about respect for the history and character of the toy, and paying attention to every detail</li>
						<li>Tailoring: I take commissions for custom garments, from the pratical to the fantastical. I have made corsets, capes and dresses from scratch, as well as smaller alterations or updates. A particular delight are clothes in miniature for teddies or dolls! I also have an interest in historical fashion and construction methods, and have recreated clothing from a variety of eras.</li>
						<li>Dyeing: I'm interested in natural and chemical methods of dyeing, exploring historical recipes and local nature. I also tend my own small garden with historical dye plants</li>
						<li>Sewing & mending: I'm always on a mission to encourage sustainability in textiles, making your clothes last and using castoffs for new art. I'm proficient in visible and invisible mending techniques for woven and knitted fabrics, and whatever is beyond wearing becomes part of the scrap box destined to be turned into patchwork art or stuffing</li>
						<li>More fibre skills: I'm constantly working on expanding my fibre skills, with some of the recent additions being tatted lace, bobbin lace, machine knitting, and fibre processing from plant to finished fabric. <a href="./contact.html">Contact me</a> if you have any ideas for projects, I'm always excited to teach and learn alike!</li>
